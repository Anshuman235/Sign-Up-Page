# Sign Up page üìù

This is basic look of a fully functional sign up page(Both frontend and Backend are being handled).

I used the Heroku App to deploy it on the web : https://thawing-badlands-34502.herokuapp.com/

It asks for the basics sign up information from the user and the data is stored at servers of MailChimp. Mailchimp provides backend services for our web application and can also be used further for more audience-engagement-centric things such as email-marketing. MailChimp provides the tools for that.

So the user's Name, email, passwords are stored at Mailchimp which can only be access by the admin using a unique key, which makes it secure.

This sign-up page currently lacks aethetics and isn't much stronger on the UI part as this was made originally for only functional purposes. 
The UI and overall appearence will be improved in the future.
